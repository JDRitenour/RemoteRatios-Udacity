## Project Goals<a name="goals"></a>

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic creating widespread romote working oppurtunties so early in my career, I have spent more time working from home than from an office. I would like to continue to work remotely as I pursue my career as a data scientist.

I used a data file I found on Kaggle to answer the following questions:
1. How is salary impacted by remote ratio?
2. How is remote ratio impacted by experience level?
3. How is remote ratio impacted by company size?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains one jupyter notebook with the code pertaining to the analysis of the research questions above.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Overall, it appears that the data scientist career path should not hinder my ability to work remotely in the future. In fact, the results of my analysis show that the data scientst career path is very amiable to remote work! A further breakdown to the results can be found here.
